    <p> This is my girlfriend's super amazing cat named <em>Minako</em>. Below is an image of Minako sitting on my bed like the exotic, mysterious creature she is. Minako does not always behave as a traditional pet should; 
        she has hissed at and attacked countless objects in my house including paper airplanes, a ripstick and my clarinet all within the span of a few months. I've heard that tuxedo cats have a tendency to be a bit on the strange 
        side but Minako effortlessly continues to surpass my expectations on how silly a cat can be. My girlfriend, Rachel, and I got Minako a little over a year ago. I was a little skeptical about getting 
        a cat, considering that Rachel is mildly allergic and that we both have never had a pet cat before. Despite my concerns, I have absolutely enjoyed every moment that I have spent with Minako so far 
        and I cannot wait to see what nefarious schemes she may have planned for in the future. As a bonus, here is a table demonstrating some of Minako's characteristics: 

        <table> 
            <tr> 
                 <th>Likes</th>
                 <th>Dislikes</th>
                 <th>Neutral Towards</th>
             </tr>
             <tr> 
                 <td>Sitting on other people's personal items</td>
                 <td>Not being fed on time</td>
                 <td>Being petted</td>
             </tr>
             <tr>
                 <td>Hissing at inanimate objects</td>
                 <td>Loud noises</td>
                 <td>Human Food</td>
              </tr>
             <tr> 
                 <td>Humans</td>
                 <td>Dogs</td>
                 <td>Other Cats</td>
             </tr>
         </table>

<h2> Post #2 </h2>

<h4>By Daniel Righter - 10/14/21</h4>

<p> For my second post, I decided to take some time to discuss an idea for what I would like my final project to be if we are asked to make a website. I'm not entirely sure how 
     practical a website like "Gamerplan" would actually be since it is a very ambituous prospect. The idea of creating a platform that combines the functions of several different 
    applications including discord and metafy so that users only need to go to one place to get the whole package seems like a no-brainer at first and that something like this should 
    already exist. However, this mindset clearly does not consider <strong>why</strong> something like this doesn't exist: if it were possible / practical, it would already be done. 
    Despite all of this, I think that creating a website that is at least functional and keeps the vision of what "Gamerplan" could be sounds like fun and I would love to give it my 
    best shot!
