    <h2> About Me </h2>

    <h4>By Daniel Righter - 10/14/21</h4>

    <p> Hello world! My name is Daniel, I am a senior at Michigan State University and I am planning on graduating this December. After graduation, I will be looking for a job 
        in the IT industry. I have never been that great at coding, but I thought that I would take this class to help me reinforce my skills since part of the job of IT is being ready 
        for <strong>anything</strong>! Here are a list of my hobbies: 

        <li> Playing Video Games </li>
        <li> Solving Problems </li>
        <li> Traveling to new places </li>

        <br>

        This picture below shows Rachel and I when we went to the Saugatuck dunes! Thank you so much for taking the time to learn about me!
